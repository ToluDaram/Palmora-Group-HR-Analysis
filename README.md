SALARY DISTRIBUTION AND MINIMUM WAGE COMPLIANCE

This analysis provides a summary of salary distribution, regional breakdowns, 
and compliance with the newly established $90,000 minimum wage regulation, 
particularly relevant to the manufacturing sector as represented in the visuals. 

Insights 
- The highest proportion of employees (21.35%) fall into the $100,000+ salary band.
- Kaduna actually has the highest number of high earners across all locations.
- Salary distribution across regions shows Kaduna leads in high salaries, followed by Abuja and Lagos.
- Minimum wage compliance is low: only 292 employees meet the $90,000 threshold, while 654 employees fall below it.
- This implies that about 69% of employees are non-compliant with the new wage regulation.
- Compliance is fairly evenly spread across departments, with no single department standing out as significantly more compliant.

Recommendartion
Palmoria must urgently address minimum wage non-compliance, especially within the manufacturing sector, to meet regulatory standards.
Focus should be on increasing salaries for the 654 employees below the $90,000 threshold.
Further investigation into regional disparities—particularly Kaduna's high salary concentration—may help guide future policy or compensation strategies.
